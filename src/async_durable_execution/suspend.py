"""
The model expects >= 1 seconds when receiving an OperationUpdate via api calls
    (see StepOptions, WaitOptions, etc)
We don't force a minimum delay_seconds OR time to timestamp here because:

1. suspension can be reached from multiple handlers,
2. suspension can be reached from multiple "contexts", e.g. top level wait, or a child retry
3. we use TimedSuspendExecution as an optimization mechanism within concurrent executions (map/parallel)
    to know when to retry without being told so.

As such, it is up to the caller to ensure consistency wrt what dataplane sees and what happens within a
function.

Behaviour:
- When we suspend without a target delay / timestamp THEN we suspend indefinitely.
- When `delay_seconds` or timestamp exist, THEN we suspend for `max(delay_seconds, 0)` or suspend for "now".
- When suspension happens within a child branch and the branch suspends for `0` seconds, THEN execution will
resume immediately as it will be inserted at the top of the queue
- When suspension happens within a child branch and the branch suspends for > 0 seconds, THEN execution will
resume as soon as `delay_seconds` have passed
- When suspension happens at the top level, then the Lambda will terminate and Dataplane is responsible
    for resuming
